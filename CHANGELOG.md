# Changelog

What changed in each release of code-kit, newest first. Versions follow the plugin manifest and the npm package `@warren-dean/code-kit`. Each release is also on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/warrendeanlangeveldt/code-kit/releases).

## 0.5.0 (2026-10-07)

Fixes for gaps found running code-kit under an autonomous lead:

- **The Bash guard recognises commands where they run.** A commit message, a heredoc, a quoted `--text` or a grep pattern that mentions `git commit`, `code-kit merge` or switching to `main` no longer trips its rule. Text a command carries, such as a commit trailer or an approval path, is still read whole.
- **A dependency approval lasts until its install is committed,** at most 7 days, instead of 60 minutes, so a story that resumes later isn't refused again. The commit that adds the package uses it up. Other approvals still last 60 minutes.
- **status and next after a send-back:**
  - `code-kit sent-back <branch>` records the commit a review sent back, and the review skill runs it;
  - the story reads as "sent back", and `next` proposes the lane's fix instead of another review, until the branch moves on;
  - a story whose dependency isn't done is blocked on it, even with commits on its branch.
- **verify holds a `lead/…` branch to the lead's paths** for what its own commits change. Lane work merged in after review isn't counted against it.
- **A lane merging its base** no longer needs fresh approvals for what the base already logged, and the ownership audit doesn't ask it to revert the base's changes.
- **A delegated merge follows the target branch's config,** so a branch can't grant itself a merge.
- **init's update keeps project skills in step with the docs' recipes:** a new skill per new recipe, updates, removals, and each skill listed on every lane agent whose paths it touches.
- **verify scans the branch's whole history for secrets:** a secret file committed and deleted again still fails, and gitleaks scans every commit when it's installed.
- **Install scripts are told apart** in the delegated dependency rule: `allowInstallScripts` takes `true`, `false` or the kinds allowed: `binary` (prebuilt binaries, as esbuild and sharp fetch), `build` or `other`.
- **Files any agent may write have a reviewer:** the lead, or a lane named in `{ "glob", "reviewer" }`. `who` and `trace` name it.

## 0.4.1 (2026-10-07)

- **The band keeps other plugins' lines:** code-kit's lines go above whatever else the band holds, such as Context Graph's "N proposals to ratify", instead of replacing it.

## 0.4.0 (2026-10-07)

code-kit in the session: a mod for Claude Code 2.1.287 or later, in the terminal and the Desktop app. Older versions skip it and keep enforcing everything through the hooks, as before. See [In the session](README.md#in-the-session).

- **The band** above the prompt shows what waits for you: approvals agents asked for (**Approve…**, with a reason you keep or rewrite), stories ready for review (**Review**, **Merge**), and a finish check failing. Each has a digit hotkey, and the band is gone when nothing waits.
- **`/lanes`** opens a pane with each lane's agent, story, branch and state, the agents at work, and what's ready. It stays current within 2 seconds of a change.
- **Refusal cards:** a code-kit refusal reads as a card with the rule, what to do, and Approve… where an approval would allow it.
- **`/approvals`** and **`/verify-branch`** print without a model call.
- **New in the CLI:** `code-kit stops` lists finish checks still failing, and `check --json` reports the config's state for the mod.
- A merge from the pane says so in its commit.
- `code-kit` with no command now prints its whole usage.

## 0.3.15 (2026-10-06)

- **`verify` accepts your Context Graph ratifications:** a change to `.ctx/graph.ctx` whose commits all carry your `Ctx-Ratified-By` trailer passes without an approval-log entry. That's what `ctx ratify --commit` and `ctx drop --commit` write from your terminal, where code-kit's hooks don't run to log it. Agents still can't write that trailer, and a delegated trailer still needs the log.

## 0.3.14 (2026-10-06)

- **Context Graph's person acts:** with Context Graph in the project, the hooks refuse `ctx ratify … --commit` and `ctx drop` from every agent, matching Context Graph 0.2.11, which makes both the person's own acts. Only a real command counts; text that mentions one, such as an `echo` or documentation, isn't refused.

## 0.3.13 (2026-10-06)

The command-line groundwork for the coming code-kit mod (`docs/brief.md`), useful on its own:

- **Approval requests:** every refusal that a person's approval would allow is now recorded as a request, once per actor and command. `code-kit requests [--json]` lists the open requests and the approvals in force, with minutes left. A request closes when its approvals are given.
- **`code-kit approve … --via pane`** marks an approval as given in the code-kit pane.
- **`code-kit merge <branch> --person`:** the person merges a branch after `verify` passes, with no delegation needed.
- **Agents:** the hooks refuse `--via` and `--person` from every agent.
- **`code-kit verify --json`** prints the branch, its lane and the problems by group.

## 0.3.12 (2026-10-05)

- **Delegated merges:** with `"approvals": { "delegate": { "merge": true } }`, the lead can merge a reviewed branch into a protected branch with `code-kit merge <branch> --delegated`. This is for an autonomous lead.
  - It runs `code-kit verify` on the branch first, checks included, and merges nothing if verify fails or the branch doesn't merge cleanly.
  - Lanes can never run it.
  - Merging by hand on a protected branch stays blocked for everyone.
- **A hole closed:** a command that switches to a protected branch and then commits, merges, cherry-picks, rebases or reverts (`git switch main && git merge x`) is now refused. Before, the branch was read only before the command ran. Moving a protected branch directly (`git branch -f main`, `git update-ref refs/heads/main`) is refused too.
- **`code-kit unowned`** no longer reports files that any actor may write, such as the lockfile.

## 0.3.11 (2026-10-04)

- **`code-kit verify` and union-merged approval logs:** verify now accepts an approval log that git merged with `merge=union`, as the README recommends.
  - **The problem:** when a lane merged its base after the base had gained log entries, git put the lane's own entries first. verify read that as a rewritten log, and then refused the lane's approved manifest changes too.
  - **Now:** it accepts the log as long as every earlier line is still there, in order. A log whose earlier lines were changed, removed or reordered still fails.

## 0.3.10 (2026-10-04)

- **Delegated ratification trailer:** Context Graph's delegated ratification trailer (`Ctx-Ratified-By: <ratifier> (delegated)`) may be written by the lead only, never by a lane. A person's trailer stays blocked for every agent, as before.
- **Adapters:** they can now add lead-only shell rules (`shell.restricted`) as well as blocked ones.

## 0.3.9 (2026-10-04)

- **Delegated approvals:** with `"approvals": { "delegate": { "protected": [...], "dependencies": {...} } }`, the lead can approve on its own authority with `code-kit approve … --delegated`. This is for a lead that runs without a person watching.
  - **Protected approvals:** only the names you list.
  - **Dependencies:** checked against the npm registry for licence, weekly downloads, recent releases and install scripts.
  - **All or nothing:** anything outside the rules approves nothing, and goes to the person.
  - **The record:** every delegated approval is marked with the rule it used.
- **`code-kit approve` takes package names:** `approve @scope/pkg` now means `dep-@scope+pkg`, where it used to refuse the name.

## 0.3.8 (2026-10-03)

- **Lead stories:** plans can give the lead its own stories (`**Lane:** lead`), such as contracts, foundations and spikes. `code-kit next` hands them to the lead instead of dispatching them, and `status` no longer calls `lead` an unknown lane.
- **Stories with no requirements:** `**Requirements:** none` marks a story that delivers no requirement, such as a spike.
- **The CLI** no longer crashes when its output is piped into `head`.

## 0.3.7 (2026-10-03)

- **Approvals from chat:** with `"approvals": { "lead": true }`, the lead can record an approval you give in chat with `code-kit approve`, for when `!` isn't available, as on a phone. The approval is marked as given in chat. The lead may also run `shell.block` commands marked `person: true` when you say so.

## 0.3.6 (2026-10-02)

- **Companion plugin:** the README, `llms.txt` and the init skill now point to Context Graph. Init mentions it once when it isn't installed, and never installs it unasked.

## 0.3.5 (2026-10-02)

- **Logo and diagram:** the npm package now includes them, and the README shows them on npmjs.com too.

## 0.3.4 (2026-10-02)

- **Dependency approvals:** each new package needs a person's approval (`dep-<package>`), for one lane or for everyone. The approval also covers the manifest and lockfile changes the install makes. The commit hook logs those changes, and `code-kit verify` accepts them.
- **A hole closed:** flags before a package name (`npm install -D lodash`) no longer slip past the guard.
- **Worktrees:** approvals are read from the main checkout, so a lane working in its own worktree sees them.
- **Wording:** the README states the hooks' deliberate limits instead of promising hard guarantees.

## 0.3.3 (2026-10-01)

- **Descriptions:** they now open with what code-kit does for AI coding agents.

## 0.3.2 (2026-10-01)

- **npm:** published as `@warren-dean/code-kit`. CI uses `npx @warren-dean/code-kit verify`.
- **For AI tools:** an `llms.txt` and an `AGENTS.md` describe the plugin.

## 0.3.1 (2026-10-01)

- **Ready to install from a public repository:** MIT licence, a security policy, and install instructions.

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-30)

- **Adapters** for tools that share a project, starting with Context Graph.
- **`code-kit trace`:** reports the requirements, lane and layer of a file.
- **Earlier layer checks:** layer rules are now checked before a write, not just after it.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-29)

- **From idea to merged code:** the spec-design, dispatch, review, status, verify and next skills, built on the rules from 0.1.0.

## 0.1.0

- **Project rules from `.claude/code-kit.json`:** lanes, layers, protected paths with an approval log, spec-check before code, and proof before finishing, all enforced by hooks.
